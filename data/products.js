      'Gaming in 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio can be very impressive. When working, placing several windows side by side can be handy. So far, there have been mostly suboptimal VA panels and some more expensive IPS representatives. Philips, on the other hand, sends a curved OLED with fast response times, 175 Hz and potentially great colors into the race. We test whether it is worth it for gamers and productive users.',
